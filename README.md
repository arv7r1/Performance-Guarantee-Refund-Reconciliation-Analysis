# Performance Guarantee & Refund Reconciliation Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes solar and energy storage production data to evaluate compliance with contractual performance guarantees and quantify potential refund exposure. The analysis mirrors real-world operational 
workflows used to monitor fleet performance, investigate underperformance, and assess financial impact at both site and portfolio levels.

The primary goal is to identify where actual energy production failed to meet guaranteed thresholds and to translate those shortfalls into dollar-denominated refund exposure for decision-making and operational 
prioritization.

---

## Key Questions Answered
- Which sites breached contractual energy guarantees?
- How frequently did breaches occur across the fleet?
- What is the total refund exposure by site and by region?
- Where should operational attention be prioritized?

---

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (tables, formulas, PivotTables, charts)
- Structured analytical documentation (Markdown)

## Outputs
- Site-level refund exposure
- Breach frequency by site
- Refund exposure by region
- Portfolio-level financial risk summary

Key charts are available in the `output/` folder for quick stakeholder review.

## Notes
- Data is synthetically generated to reflect realistic operational and contractual patterns.
- No proprietary or customer data is used.
- All calculations are deterministic and reproducible.

This project demonstrates analytical approaches aligned with energy operations, performance monitoring, and contractual compliance workflows.
